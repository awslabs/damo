- Test --numa_node 0 case
- Implement histogram stat regions output
- damo show features implementation
  - support target damos filter
  - time based filtering
  - collapse by time
  - collapse by priority value (more histogram control)
    - --histogram hotness?
  - Implement min/max snapshot format keyword
- damo reclaim: add a command for basic investigation
  - helps ensure DAMON_RECLAIM is working as expected
  - helps reporting issue
- Handle _damon_sysfs file i/o error for unsupported kernel features and
  conflicts with concurrent ones
- Optimize 'replay' performance
  - An approach for 2 MiB-granularity page management didn't show improvement
  - Optionally use C program like 'masim'
- Let 'replay' further parse vmas and alloc/release memory
- Unify wss and footprints report types
- Fixup 'damo show' on schemes_tried_regions unsupported kernels
  - Either make the warning clear, or support it using trace points
  - (https://github.com/awslabs/damo/issues/101)
- 'diagnose' command
  - check if nr_regions in bound
  - check if DAMOS quota is in control
- 'damo monitor'
  - add option to add snapshot as (optional) alternate of heatmap
- Show temperature histogram on holistic report
- status: Show kdamond cpu usage
- heatmap: Support interactive zoom in/out/scrolling
- extend/unify common workflow commands
  - args: Format complext command arguments like DAMON parameters in json and
    snapshot formatter
  - extend record/report, deprecate show and status.
    - extend record for snapshot capturing (done: --snapshot)
      - damo record --snapshot <delay> <count> (done)
    - extend report to do record
      - damo report --input record <deductible target> <timeout>
      - damo report --input snapshot <delay> <count>
      - If --input is not given, and a kdamond is running, snapshot once
      - If --input is not given, no kdamond is running, use damon.data if
        exists
    - allow report repeating
    - deprecate monitor
- Record DAMON status
- Report DAMON status
- Deprecate 'damo status'
- Implement single report formatter
  - Extend 'report access' format arguments for wss, memfootprint, etc
- Provide virtual memory mapping information
  - shows when what virtual address has mappend and unmapped

- Deprecate old features
  - Deprecate fmt_json in favor of 'args damon'
    - notified as will-be-deprecated by 2024-11
  - Deprecate heats report type in favor of heatmap report type
  - Deprecate translate_damos (done.)
  - Deprecate single line per-scheme (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate v1-v3 schemes (done.  necessary code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate python2 support (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate scheme subcommand
    - Can be replaced by start or tune
  - Deprecate old scheme usages in tests
  - Deprecate DAMON results record binary format (done.  code moved to
    _damon_deprecated)
